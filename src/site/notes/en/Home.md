🇧🇷 🇵🇹 [[pt/Home\|Fala português? Venha aqui]]

This is Thiago (Zozô) Ozores' chaotically organized salad of information and notes. It's a new outfit for a blog (but this is not a blog anymore, it's a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) 🏡, which is a much fancier name, by the way 😁) that I had a long time ago that no one but me has read, and I believe no one but me will read. 😂

But if by chance you got lost on the internet and ended up here, welcome!! and first of all, DON'T PANIC!

I've been through 9️⃣9️⃣9️⃣9️⃣ websites, blogs, flogs (now I've given away my age), etc., trying to have some content here in cyberspace, so patience.
