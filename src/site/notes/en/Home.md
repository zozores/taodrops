## 👨 Who Am I?

I'm Thiago (Zozô) Ozores, Site Reliability Engineer @ Itaú Unibanco and this is my salad of information and notes chaotically organized, this is a new outfit of a blog (this is no longer a blog, it's a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) 🏡, much more fancier name by the way 😁) that I had a long time ago that nobody but me, read and I believe that nobody but me, will read. 😂
But if, by any chance, you've lost your way on the internet and landed here, welcome!!! and first of all, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">DON'T PANIC!</mark>

I've been through 9️⃣9️⃣9️⃣9️⃣ websites, blogs, flogs, etc, trying to have some content here in cyberspace, so patience.
